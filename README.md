## Description

A short summary of how this project came to be:

- My driving goal with this project was to ensure I understood how to build an application with basic fundamentals.
- To reengage with understanding my basics, along with a few pieces of new information, is my biggest factor in creating this application.
- Building this project put missing pieces of my recollection of how coding works by structuring.
- I learned that even though I have gotten very rusty with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript functions, I can pick them back up with relative ease.

## Usage

This project aims to help both beginners and experienced coders with a structure on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript operate while working. Even if the work becomes second nature, having a template such a this shows what the bare minimum can accomplish just from realizing exactly how the three create, connect, and contain data. Feel free to use this as much as you like!

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
